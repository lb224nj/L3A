|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Add expense to a category. (Req: 1)                  | Selected 'Add an expense to a category' option (1), selected month October and chose rent as category and added amount 500. Then I checked the yearly total expense for the category and if the data.json month and category was updated with 500. | data.json should show updated October expense regarding 'rent' with 500 added. Yearly total expenses should also reflect this. | OK                                                                          |
| 2. View yearly total expense for a category. (Req: 5)   | Selected 'View yearly total expenses for a category' option (2), and chose a specific category. Then I compared the result with the numbers in data.json. | Output should display the correct total yearly expense and be the same as the summarized expenses for specific category found in data.json.                                                                         | OK                                                                          |
| 3. View Average Monthly expenses for a category. (Req: 2) | Selected 'View average monthly expenses for a category' option (3), and chose rent as category. Compared the result with data in data.json and numbers of months stored in data.json | Output should display the average monthly expense for the specific category.                                                                       | OK (Users can see average monthly expense for specific category but no logic for comparing categories like a list from most expensive to cheapest has been implemented because of lack of time) |
| 4. Compare months. (Req: 3)                             | No such logic has been implemented and therefore not tested.                                             | No expected output since not implemented.                                                                         | NOT OK (logic has not been implemented due to lack of time, high priority in continuation of development of application and is planned to be implemented in next version) |
| 5. Data saved in JSON file format. (Req: 4)             | Selected 'Add an expense to a category' option (1) and chose a month I had not used before (June) and a category not used before (clothing) and checked if data.json was updated with new data | data.json should reflect added amount under 'june' and category 'clothing'.                                                                         | OK                                                                          |
